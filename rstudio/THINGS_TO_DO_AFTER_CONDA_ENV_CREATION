THINGS TO DO AFTER CREATING A NEW CONDA ENVIRONMENT
1. Activate the conda environment.
2. Source "SOURCE_AFTER_ENV_CREATION.sh". (Running within a subshell does not work properly.) This script
	#- copies "Renviron.site" into "${CONDA_PREFIX}/lib/R/etc/" (sets RETICULATE_PYTHON)
	- copies "Rprofile.site" into "${CONDA_PREFIX}/lib/R/etc/" (sets user-specific library path)
	- installs R packages not properly managed by conda
